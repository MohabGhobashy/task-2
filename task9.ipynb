    "<h3>Different Software Architecture Patterns :</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    " <p style=\"color:red;\">Layered Pattern</p>\n",
    "  <p style=\"color:red;\">Client-Server Pattern</p>\n",
    "  <p style=\"color:red;\">Event-Driven Pattern</p>\n",
    "  <p style=\"color:red;\">Microkernel Pattern</p>\n",
    "  <p style=\"color:red;\">Microservices Pattern</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>1. Layered Pattern :</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- components(code) in this pattern are separated into layers of subtasks and they are arranged one above another.\n",
    "- *Ideal for:*  E-commerce web applications development like Amazon. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>2. Client-Server Pattern :</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The client-server pattern has two major entities. They are a server and multiple clients. \n",
    "- Here the server has resources(data, files or services) and a client requests the server for a particular resource. Then the server processes the request and responds back accordingly.\n",
    "- *Ideal for:*  developing the kind of software listed in the examples.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>3. Event-Driven Pattern :</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event-Driven Architecture is an agile approach in which services (operations) of the software are triggered by events. \n",
    "- *Ideal for:*  Building websites with JavaScript and e-commerce websites in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>4. Microkernel Pattern :</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Microkernel pattern has two major components. They are a core system and plug-in modules. \n",
    "   - The core system handles the fundamental and minimal operations of the application.\n",
    "   - The plug-in modules handle the extended functionalities (like extra features) and customized processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *ideal for:*  Product-based applications and scheduling applications. We love new features that keep giving dopamine boost to our brain. Such as Instagram reels, YouTube Shorts and a lot more that feasts us digitally. So this pattern is mostly preferred for app development.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>5. Microservices Pattern :</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The collection of small services that are combined to form the actual application is the concept of microservices pattern. Instead of building a bigger application, small programs are built for every service (function) of an application independently. And those small programs are bundled together to be a full-fledged application.  \n",
    "- *Example:* Netflix is one of the most popular examples of software built-in microservices architecture. This pattern is most suitable for websites and web apps having small components. "

    "<h3>What is Cron Job?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "A cron job is a Linux command used for scheduling tasks to be executed sometime in the future. This is normally used to schedule a job that is executed periodically â€“ for example, to send out a notice every morning. Some scripts, such as Drupal and WHMCS may require you to set up cron jobs to perform certain functions.\n",
